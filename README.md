# Scripts
Scripts that preform various tasks

Sugarcane.py - This file is used for automation within a minecraft server. I chose to use minecraft for this automation project because the game allows for simple movement.
Everything within minecraft is block related, so most tasks can be done by facing 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. With this script in place, the character in minecraft will
walk backward while collecting two rows of sugarcane. Then, after the character gets to the end of the sugarcane farm he will walk sideways to the next 2 rows and start 
collecting again. This script allows for me to be away from my computer while also collecting thousands of sugarcane an hour.
